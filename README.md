# PowerBI

## PowerBI
Previously, I created a dashboard in Excel to analyze movie data. I decided to recreate this dashboard in PowerBI to compare the two tools and evaluate their functionalities.

You can find my previous Excel dashboard here:  [Dashboard in Excel](https://github.com/Mary-Pronina/Movies-Data.git). The main objective of the dashboard is to analyze movie data and gain insights 
into which movies, genres, and actors were the most successful in terms of box office revenue and ROI. Through this analysis, PowerBI demonstrated itself as the superior tool, 
offering more advanced features and better data visualization capabilities.

The first picture closely resembles the Excel version, while the second picture presents the information in a more professional and detailed manner:

Here we see information in a more refined and comprehensive way:

Specifically, PowerBI excels in:

 - Interactive Visualizations: PowerBI allows for more dynamic and interactive data visualizations, making it easier to explore and present insights.
 - Data Connectivity: It offers robust connectivity to various data sources, simplifying the process of updating and integrating new data.
 - Customization: PowerBI provides extensive customization options for creating tailored reports and dashboards.
 - User Interface: The intuitive user interface in PowerBI makes it easier to create complex dashboards without extensive training.
